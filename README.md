 Maharastra is the State that contributed more to the sales with New Dehli the least, Set has the Highest selling category while Bottom has the least, Amazon, Myntra and Flipkart are the first, second and the third channel that contributed to the maximum sales.

 ** RECOMMENDATION & CONCLUSION**
 The organization should make sure that all products under the "Set" category are always available, and since Amazon remain the highest contributing channel to the maximum sales, the organization should also make it easier and affordable for people to make their orders on amazon. In conclusion awareness program should be carried out in state like New Dehli and other states that contributed less to the sales.
